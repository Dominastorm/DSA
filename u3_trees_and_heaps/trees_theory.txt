Types of binary trees

1. Strictly - every node in the tree has eiher 0 or 2 children

2. Fully - all leaf nodes are at the same level

3. Complete - all levels are completely filled except possible the last level, and the last level has all keys as left as possible.

4. BST - left subtree has nodes smaller than parent and right has greater than
       - left and right subtrees are also BSTs
