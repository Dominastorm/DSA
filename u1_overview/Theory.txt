Working of realloc() 
1. Contents unchanged until the minimum of the two sizes (new and old)
2. If new size is larger than old size, new memory is allocated but not initialized
3. If ptr is NULL, acts like malloc(size) for size > 0 
4. If ptr is not NULL, and size is 0, act like free(ptr)
5. It can move the memory to a new location
6. It will return a pointer to the newly allocated memory
